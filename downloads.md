We strongly recommend that you read through the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq) and watch the [Introduction Video]({{ site.baseurl }}/introduction) before using LiveSplit for the first time.

### [LiveSplit Development Build](http://livesplit.org/LiveSplitDevBuild.zip)

The Development Build is released with every new change on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit) and has all of the latest features and improvements to LiveSplit. However, this build may be less stable and have some bugs as a result.

In order to keep your settings from previous versions, copy the settings.cfg file from your old LiveSplit folder into the new one.
