**Q: How do I develop an Auto Splitter?**  
A: The [Auto Splitter Documentation](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters/blob/master/README.md) is a very useful resource and guide for developing Auto Splitter components and ASL scripts.
If you need any further help, feel free to join the [Speedrun Tool Development Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6wv8pW).

**Q: Is there a way to report bugs?**  
A: If you find a bug in LiveSplit, feel free to contact {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.cryze_username %} or {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.wooferzfg_username %} on Twitter.
You can also go to the [LiveSplit Issues](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/issues) page and make a new issue.

**Q: Is there a way to submit ideas?**  
A: If you have an idea or suggestion for a new LiveSplit feature, feel free to contact {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.cryze_username %} or {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.wooferzfg_username %} on Twitter. We will often prioritize what we implement next based on your feedback.

**Q: Is LiveSplit open source?**  
A: LiveSplit is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit).
We want the community to be able to extend LiveSplit and to add additional features that we might not have the time to add right away.
Components are great for doing this, as they can simply work as add-ons and anyone can create them.

**Q: I want to develop a component and can’t find any documentation.**  
A: We’ll create documentation as soon as possible. For now, you can take a look at existing components on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiveSplit).

**Q: How can I import splits from another timer like WSplit or Llanfair?**  
A: Just open them via "Open Splits From File…".

**Q: How do I remove/rename a comparison?**  
A: You can right click on the column header of the comparison in the Splits Editor and select Rename or Remove.

**Q: How do I put one of my components in a separate window?**  
A: In order to have multiple windows with different layouts, just open a second instance of LiveSplit with the same splits but with a different layout.
With Global Hotkeys on, splitting on both windows will be synced.
Warnings when resetting will pop up twice if they are not turned off, though.

**Q: How can I delete a best segment?**  
A: Simply select the cells that you want to clear and press the delete key on your keyboard.
It’ll fill them with segment information from your Personal Best.

**Q: Which URLs are supported when I open splits from URL?**  
A: Any direct URL to LiveSplit splits or splits from another timer (except Llanfair) is supported.
Also, it’ll open split links from [Speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com) or [Splits i/o](http://splits.io) directly as well.
